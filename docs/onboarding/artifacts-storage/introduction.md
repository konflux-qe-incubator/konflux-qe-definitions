In modern software development, test platforms play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of applications. These platforms rely heavily on artifacts—various files and data that represent different stages of the development lifecycle—to effectively manage, test, and deploy software. Artifacts are more than just components of a build; they are the tangible outputs of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes.

## Why Artifacts Are Crucial for Test Platforms

In the world of software development, testing is where you make sure everything works as it should. And to do that effectively, you need artifacts. These are the important files and resources that come from different stages of development—like container images, Helm charts, JAR files, and more.

Here’s why having a good system for managing artifacts is so important for your test platforms:

**1. Faster and More Efficient Testing**: When artifacts are managed well, you spend less time searching for files or dealing with mismatches. This means you can test and deploy your software faster. And in today’s fast-paced development world, speed is key.

**2. Clear and Detailed Tracking**: Artifacts provide a detailed record of what has been tested and when. This clear tracking helps you understand how your software is performing and meets any regulatory requirements. It’s like having a complete history of your tests, making it easier to find and fix issues.

**3. Flexibility and Easy Integration**: Your test platform needs to handle various types of artifacts and work well with different tools. 

In short, artifacts are more than just files—they’re essential for making sure your software works right. By managing them effectively, you streamline your testing process and improve the quality of your software.

After careful consideration, the Konflux QE team has decided to use [**ORAS**](https://oras.land) as the solution for managing storage artifacts. ORAS is an open-source tool that provides a unified way to manage and interact with various types of artifacts. Its flexibility, efficiency, and compatibility make it a perfect fit for our testing processes, ensuring that we maintain consistency and streamline our workflows.
